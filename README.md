PHP and HTML only, no CSS, no JS, no Frameworks [final project for Introduction to IT at UPB]

The assignment is as the title said, I had very peculiar restrictions to go around while creating this project.
For the design I used inspiration from early internet websites from https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/.
Particularly these websites:
  https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/gallery/pixel-industries-1996
  https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/gallery/2advanced-studios-v3-2001
  https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/gallery/space-jam-1996

If you are ever found in constraints such as these ones, which is in my opinion very unlikely unless it's a school assignment or challenge
I recommend using these resources for any styling needs:
  https://www.w3.org/TR/html401/
  https://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/html40/olist.html
  
To run this website you must download all the files and modify the configuration files according to your situation.

This application is very simple and it is composed only of a single class named ZodiacFinder.
  What ZodiacFinder does is to compute and return a Zodiac sign based on the input date.

Another interesting functionality this app has is to fetch the tomorrow's predictions from the website horoscope.com for each respective zodiac sign.
  This functionality however is not embedded in any class but it's written directly in each page of each zodiac sign due to time constraints at the
  making of the app, but the code was written in such a way that it could be easily adjusted for each zodiac sign page.

I am expecting in the future to create a more modern version of this application.
